Exercise 3: Practising working with commits 10%

Create a folder on the command line and turn it into a Git project.
Create a file called story.txt in your project. Add a lot of text inside.
Add another file called shopping_list.txt to the project, and write down what you need from the store (or just many rows of text).
Create a subfolder called school into the project, and create a file calledlapio.txt inside. You will need these files in the future exercises.
After doing all the changes described above, create a total of three commits: one, where you add the story, a second on where you add the shopping list, and a third one where you add the school folder. Make sure that each commit message is truly descriptive.
Using the command git log, check that you have properly created three commits.
Add something new to the shopping list, and create another commit. Use the command git add -p.
Make sure you can see all the commits in the output of git log.
